## Installation

### [Pathogen]

``` kak
pathogen-infect /home/user/repositories/github.com/alexherbo2/connect.kak
```

## Usage

You can use `:connect` to create a new terminal with `[e]dit`, `[b]uffer` and `EDITOR` connected to the client.

If you open a file using the shell command `edit` or an application using the default editor,
the file will be opened in the client from where `:connect` was executed.

You can also open a buffer by using the `buffer` command (or its alias `b`).
With no argument, `buffer` will list the available buffers.

### Examples

``` kak
:connect # Spawn a terminal
```

From that terminal:

``` sh
$ edit example.txt
```

You can also run the shell commands from Kakoune.

For example, [lf] and [fzf] integration can be:

``` kak
def lf %(connect lf)
```

``` kak
def fzf-files %(connect edit $(fzf))
```

``` kak
alias global fzf fzf-files
```

``` kak
def fzf-buffers %(connect buffer $(buffer | fzf))
```
